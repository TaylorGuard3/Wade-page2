<h1>Dwyane Wade<h1>

<h2>Greatest Shooting Guard of All-Time<h2>
	
<div id="fix"
<p>Dwyane Tyrone Wade came in the league at just 23 years old. A player with a huge upside but continously being overlooked his peers, Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James.</p>

<p>A shock to me except, his diehard fans (yours truley), he went out to take the league by storm. Wade gained his respect and ultimately was the first in his draft class to win an NBA Champship in 2003. That series he averaged around 40 points and put up a performance Jordan didn't even display.</p>

<p>Dwyane Wade continued his stellar performances especially his best season to date which was the <a href="https://youtu.be/A_X0I_pk8YI" target="_blank">2008 NBA season</a>. He averaged 30.2 points per game that season. He also was a huge part in team USA bringing the gold that same that summer, he had <a href="https://youtu.be/LY8vmXKK2GU" target="blank">crucial and cluthch plays</a> that were much needed on a star studed USA team.</p>
